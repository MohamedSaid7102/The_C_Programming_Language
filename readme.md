# C Book Exercises Solutions

Welcome to this repository! This project contains my personal solutions to all exercises from the **C programming book** I'm studying. The goal of this repo is to:

- Practice C from the ground up
- Write clean, readable, and well-structured code
- Track progress as I go through the book
- Build a full reference of solved problems

## 📁 Structure

Each chapter has its own folder, and inside it you'll find:

- The exercise code
- Notes or explanations when needed

## 🚀 Progress

I'll keep pushing new solutions as I complete more exercises.

## 🧠 Notes

These solutions reflect my own understanding and style. They're not always the only way—but they help me grow as a programmer.

## 🤝 Contributions

This repo is mainly for personal learning, but feel free to explore or suggest improvements.
